			👋 Hello! I'm Stephanie Honore, an experienced software engineer with a passion for crafting exceptional user experiences. 
			With 7+ years of industry experience, I specialize in frontend development using JavaScript and .NET. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			💡 I thrive on building scalable microservice architectures with Docker and Kubernetes, ensuring robust backends to complement the frontend magic. 
			Additionally, my Master's degree in Computer Science, with a focus on Data Science, equips me with a data-driven mindset. 
			Currently, I'm brushing up my machine learning skills using Jupyter Notebooks, Python, PyTorch, SpaCy, and TensorFlow. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			🏗️ I believe in pragmatic and maintainable solutions that don't overcomplicate things. Quality code that scales without unnecessary 
			complexity is my mantra. With expertise in Azure, AWS, and GCP, I can leverage cloud platforms to build scalable and reliable solutions. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			🚀 Beyond software engineering, I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast, staying updated with the latest trends by attending conferences and meetups. When I'm not coding, you'll find me kayaking, 
			camping, painting, and making music with AI.
