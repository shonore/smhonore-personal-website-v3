			👋 Hello! I'm Stephanie Honore, an experienced software engineer with a passion for crafting exceptional user experiences. 
			With 7+ years of industry experience, I specialize in frontend development using JavaScript and .NET. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			💡 While frontend development is my primary expertise, I'm no stranger to the backend world. I have successfully built scalable 
			backends using microservice architecture, harnessing technologies like Docker and Kubernetes. This hands-on experience has given 
			me a comprehensive understanding of full-stack development and the ability to design robust systems that can withstand the test of time.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			🎓 Equipped with a Master's degree in Computer Science, focusing on Data Science, I bring a data-driven mindset to my work. Currently, I'm 
			further honing my skills in machine learning, immersing myself in Jupyter Notebooks, Python, PyTorch, SpaCy, and TensorFlow. By staying at 
			the forefront of this ever-evolving field, I bring innovative solutions that leverage data to drive actionable insights.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			🏗️ I believe in pragmatic and maintainable solutions that don't overcomplicate things. Quality code that scales without unnecessary 
			complexity is my mantra. With expertise in Azure, AWS, and GCP, I can leverage cloud platforms to build scalable and reliable solutions. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			🚀 Beyond software engineering, I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast, staying updated with the latest trends by attending conferences and meetups. When I'm not coding, you'll find me kayaking, 
			camping, painting, and making music with AI.
